This repository stores additions to the Contiki Operating System
in order to support HiKoB Openlab platforms.

Additions are done through new contiki platform definitions and
the use of openlab low level drivers.

All additional work can be found in 

  /platform/openlab
  /platform/openlab-fox
  /platform/openlab-newt

So far no other file has been modified in the repository and a
simple copy of openlab directories to a contiki system should
be enough if you want to merge this version with your already
modified repository.


Finishing installation and first compilation
============================================

To complete the installatin process you only need to add 
a copy or a link to the openlab source code in 

  /platform/openlab/git

The link can be done quite easily on Unix using the following
command:

  ln -s [openlab path] [contiki path]/platform/openlab/git

Windows may have to copy the whole source tree.

Please refer to OpenLab installation notes for compiler and
jtag setup.

Compilation and download
========================

new contiki TARGETs are openlab-fox and openlab-newt. The 
prefered way to flash firmware is by using openocd. 

Special make targets are pre-built to make everything easy.

From a projetct you can use the following make command lines

* building the firmware:    make TARGET=openlab-[xxx] prog
* flash the firmware:       make TARGET=openlab-[xxx] prog.u

* perform a reset:          make TARGET=openlab-[xxx] reset
* enter GDB session mode:   make TARGET=openlab-[xxx] debug
